=======================
GEDCOM processing stuff
=======================

So I do quite a bit of genealogical research work.  It is one of my more time
consuming hobbies.  A large part of genealogy is data entry and data cleanup.
This codebase is something that I wrote to make manipulating GEDCOM files in
interesting ways a lot easier.  Maybe it will make your life a little easier
too.
